            <p><span class="dropCap">A</span><p> small, impish grin spread across Jeff Sessions' face. It was a sun-drenched June afternoon, and the controversial U.S. attorney general was in Scranton, a Northeastern Pennsylvania town a few generations removed from its heyday as the heartbeat of the region's coal mining industry. Protesters stood outside a local university and jeered him, but Sessions was safely ensconced inside a stately, window-lined hall, preaching to a few dozen cops, prosecutors, and police cadets with high-and-tight haircuts about the importance of President Trump's war on illegal immigration. </p>
<p>Sessions focused on the scourge of so-called sanctuary cities, which had more than doubled in number across the country ever since Trump took office in 2017. After riffing on the dangers of these locales — They reject immigration law! They disrespect ICE officers! — he smiled and mentioned Jim Kenney, Philadelphia's Democratic mayor. </p>
<p>Philadelphia had emerged as one of the largest thorns in the Trump administration's side. It wore its sanctuary designation like a badge of honor, and its leaders, including Kenney and District Attorney Larry Krasner, continued to find new and creative ways to outmaneuver ICE's enforcement efforts in the city. Just a week before Sessions arrived in Scranton, Philadelphia made national headlines for winning a federal lawsuit that Kenney had filed against the Department of Justice. At risk had been a $1.6 million law enforcement grant, and the critical question of whether Philadelphia — and by implication, cities like New York, Chicago and San Francisco — had the right to limit the information and cooperation they provided to ICE.</p>

{% set ad = ["21"] %} {% include "partials/ad.html" %}

<p>The attorney general told his audience that he'd seen a video of Kenney dancing giddily in the wake of the court victory. "He is celebrating keeping criminals in Philadelphia that by law should be deported," Sessions said, in his heavy Alabama drawl. But it was worse than that; cities like Philadelphia, he said, "send a message to criminals: 'Stay here, and we will protect you.' That directly attracts more criminals."</p>
<p>This is how the Trump administration had typically portrayed sanctuary cities, as reckless, lawless outposts where crime was now rampant, thanks to liberal politicians. Kenney saw his administration's role in a more noble light. By wielding policy like a sword to fight back against Trump and ICE — like in July, when Kenney would announce that he was cutting off ICE's access to a real-time database of local arrest information — the city's leaders believed they were helping vulnerable immigrants to go about their lives without having to feel hunted. </p>
<p>"Trump and Sessions and those folks rule by division and fear, by putting out intentionally wrong views of who people are and what they are, and what they aspire to be," Kenney said during a recent interview at City Hall. </p>
<p>Later in the conversation, as his cheeks bloomed red, Kenney elaborated: "[Trump] wants to use Philadelphia to play to the heartland of people who are scared of anyone that's a different color than them. This is about brown and black people. This is not about immigration. This is about the browning of America." </p>
<p>When the Trump and Kenney administrations tell this story, it follows neatly drawn lines: One side is good, the other is bad, and neither wavers from its mission. But reporting by ProPublica and the Inquirer reveals that the truth is sometimes messier, and doesn't always match the rhetoric. </p>
<p>For all of Sessions' warnings about the threat of violent, undocumented immigrants, ICE officials admit that their officers are now largely pursuing people in the Philadelphia area who have simply overstayed their visas. The agency complains that an executive order signed by Kenney prevents it from apprehending dangerous immigrants who are being held in city jails, or even interviewing those inmates while they're behind bars. But the raw numbers suggest the agency isn't quite as desperate as it claims to get access to what amounts to a handful of people on a weekly basis.  </p>
<p>And despite Kenney's stated refusals to cooperate with ICE, not everyone follows that script. Sometimes cops, probation officers and even members of his own administration tip off ICE about undocumented immigrants who should be on the agency's radar. </p>
<p>For immigrants who see cities like Philadelphia as a beacon, as a bubble that will protect them, these contradictions are an unsettling reminder that nothing is ever quite what it seems.    </p>
<p>Subhead TK</p>
<p>It was possible, back in 2015, to envision a scenario where Philadelphia would be in constant conflict with a Trump-led Justice Department. </p>
<p>That June, Trump stood behind a lectern that was fronted by a simple sign bearing his name and, in tiny script, a slogan that would soon become inescapable: Make America Great Again. Trump announced to a crowd of reporters and supporters who'd gathered at Trump Tower in New York City that he'd decided to run for president. And in a speech that was short on policy but long on examples of how America didn't win anymore, his immigration platform took shape. </p>
<p>"The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everyone else's problems," he said. "When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best . . . They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people." </p>
<p>Meanwhile, one hundred miles from New York, Kenney was running for mayor with a decidedly different message. He'd grown up in blue collar South Philly, which typically voted Democrat but leaned conservative; this was an area of the city where some residents still worshipped the memory of Frank Rizzo, the late mayor and police commissioner whose "vote white" messaging and iron-fisted law enforcement tactics offered a blueprint, 40 years earlier, for Trump's eventual rise. </p>
<p>But Kenney had distanced himself from those roots. As a city councilman and then a mayoral candidate, he touted his progressive bonafides, like his early support for LGBTQ rights and welcoming stance towards immigrant communities, which had played a significant role in Philadelphia's recent population growth. "Cities are at the epicenter of our nation's broken immigration system," Kenney wrote that summer in an editorial for Al Dia, the city's dual-language newspaper. </p>
<p>He vowed that, if he was elected mayor, he'd continue to abide by an executive order that then-Mayor Michael Nutter signed in 2014, which barred the city from honoring ICE detainer requests for undocumented immigrants who'd been charged with other crimes, unless the requests were accompanied by a judicial warrant. </p>
<p>The policy instantly made Philadelphia one of the strictest sanctuary cities in the U.S. That distinction that didn't happen overnight; Nutter's order was the product of years of lobbying from immigration activists, and a reflection of the increasingly fraught relationship between ICE and municipalities across the country. But that tension hadn't always been present.</p>
<p>Charles H. Ramsey was the police chief in Washington, D.C., in 2003, when ICE was created by Congress as part of the Department of Homeland Security. Ramsey later served eight years as Philadelphia's police commissioner, and recalled having an easy working relationship with ICE officials in both cities. "But immigration was not a hot button issue then," he said. "We didn't participate in round-ups [of immigrants]. That sort of thing was not a priority." </p>
<p>The friction point came later, during the early years of Barack Obama's presidency. Immigration advocates had expected Obama to champion legislative reforms that would lead to a path for citizenship for many of the country's 11 million undocumented. Instead, his first years in office were marked by the highest deportation rate in history, peaking at more than 300,000 arrests per year in 2010 and 2011. </p>
<p>The increase in deportations partly came down to timing. Obama took office just as a program rolled out under President George W. Bush, called Secure Communities, was being fully implemented.  The program shared fingerprint data between local prisons and the federal government, alerting ICE any time an undocumented immigrant was arrested. It also allowed ICE to request that immigrants be held for 48 hours beyond their mandated release date, allowing ICE agents enough time to venture to the jails and take the individuals into custody.</p>
<p>Obama expanded Secure Communities, which became a well-oiled deportation machine, scooping up any immigrant who came into contact with the criminal justice system. State and local prisons and jails were the starting point for more than 85 percent of ICE arrests in 2010 and 2011, according to an analysis by the Migration Policy Institute. </p>
<p>The government even reimbursed state and local prisons for a portion of corrections officers' salaries, depending on the number of undocumented immigrants who were in their prisons. Data compiled by the Government Accountability Office shows that between 2002 and 2015, Philadelphia received more than $1.7 million through the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, while the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections pocketed more than $16 million. </p>
<p>As advocates watched thousands of immigrants with deep ties to their communities get picked up and swiftly deported for running a traffic light or driving while intoxicated, they began to push for local solutions — filing lawsuits over the constitutionality of prisons detaining immigrants for ICE, and convincing cities to adopt sanctuary policies that would protect even immigrants who were convicted of violent crimes. (Obama ended Secure Communities in 2014, and directed ICE to target undocumented immigrants with violent records.) </p>
<p>For New Sanctuary, a Christian-affiliated organization, the push for full protection was wrapped up in faith. "If we believe in forgiveness and everyone is a child of God and second chances, then if someone has made a mistake and served their time and comes out . . . well, actually, we need to welcome them back to the community, not exile them as bad people," said Peter Pedemonti, New Sanctuary's co-founder. </p>
<p>Government officials took notice of the widespread adoption of sanctuary policies. Then-Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and ICE Director Sarah Saldana visited Philadelphia in an attempt to find a compromise with Nutter over his sudden refusal to cooperate with detainer requests. </p>
<p>"We wanted to get them to work with us in a manner that suited their community. Nobody with a misdemeanor, but serious criminals," Saldana said. "Some jurisdictions shut the door in our face. San Francisco was one, Philly was another." </p>
<p>But Nutter made a surprise concession during his final weeks as mayor in 2015, changing Philadelphia's sanctuary policy, so that it would abide by detainer requests for immigrants who'd been convicted of a felony. Some viewed this sudden change of heart as a calculated political exchange; shortly after he left office, Nutter joined the Homeland Security Advisory Council. He declined to comment. </p>
<p>When Kenney took office in January 2016, one of his first moves was to undo Nutter's changes, and reaffirm that Philadelphia wouldn't detain immigrants for ICE, or provide the agency with advance notice before an inmate was released. </p>
<p>Legislators' attitudes had changed, however, in the two years since Nutter made Philadelphia a sanctuary city. Immigration replaced the war on terrorism as the country's most volatile political football. Both U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey and Pennsylvania State Rep. Martina White introduced legislation in 2016 to strip sanctuary cities of local and federal funding. Their attempts failed, but that didn't stop Trump from trying cut funding to those cities — which had grown from 40 in 2008 to nearly 600 — after he took office. The president was overruled by a federal judge. </p>
<p>This spring, on an early May morning, Kenney visited a multicultural fair that was held outside Furness High School in South Philly. Students gathered under tents representing their nationalities, shared food and laughed easily as pop music thumped from a set of speakers. The mayor was fuming over White House chief of staff John Kelly, who had told NPR that same week that the majority of undocumented immigrants are "overwhelmingly rural people" with middle school educations who don't easily assimilate into life in the U.S. </p>
<p>Trump, during a meeting about sanctuary cities and immigration with California sheriffs, went even further. "These aren't people, he said. "These are animals."</p>
<p>The comments incensed Kenney, who thought of his own Irish heritage, and the hatred Irish refugees faced when they fled to America in the 1800s. He couched his dislike of Trump in schoolyard terms. "I love fighting bullies. Bullies have no place in this society, and bullies always lose in the end," he said. "And this bully will lose." </p>
<p></p><p>Subhead TK</p>
<p>Set aside the bluster, and you're left with the matter of whether sanctuary policies have a negative impact on public safety, or if the Trump administration has wildly overstated the threat that's posed by undocumented immigrants. </p>
<p>During a rally in Pensacola, Fla., in December 2017, Trump referenced Kate Steinle, a 32-year-old woman who was fatally shot in San Francisco two years earlier by an undocumented immigrant named Jose Innes Garcia Zarate. "She was killed by this guy, an illegal alien who had been deported five times," Trump said. "San Francisco is a sanctuary city, in other words, a city run by politicians who would rather protect criminal aliens than American citizens." </p>
<p>Sessions similarly told a story in Scranton about an undocumented immigrant from Gambia who shoved his girlfriend into an oven during an argument in Philadelphia. The man was arrested by local police, but the city didn't honor a detainer request from ICE. The man was released from a Philadelphia jail, but ICE agents later tracked him down and took him into custody.</p>
<p>"ICE tells us that they are able to locate only about six percent of the criminals they ask sanctuary jurisdictions to turn over," Sessions said. "The other 94 percent are walking free." </p>
<p>But the trial between Philadelphia and the Justice Department cast a different light on the population that ICE agents are actually pursuing in the region. David O'Neill, an assistant director from ICE's Philadelphia Field Office, testified in May that "about half of the individuals that we have interest in are Visa overstays, while the other [half] had entered the country illegally." </p>
<p>That's not to say that immigrants don't commit crimes. Data provided by the Defenders Association of Philadelphia, which represents the vast majority of local undocumented immigrants who face criminal charges, offered a glimpse at a typical month's worth of cases. The office had 32 clients in July who were undocumented immigrants; the most serious offenses included 12 people who were charged with driving under the influence, seven who'd been charged with drug possession, one person who was charged with attempted murder, and another who was accused of rape. </p>
<p>But the trial revealed other gaps in the Trump administration's narrative. While Sessions painted a picture of cities overrun by immigrants who get away scot free because of ignored detainer requests, court records show that ICE filed just 164 detainer requests with Philadelphia officials between Jan. 1, 2016 and Jan. 18, 2018 — roughly three a week. ICE officers also requested to interview just three inmates during that same period of time. </p>
<p>"The problem is that we can't really just rely on an ICE agent's word to hold somebody. Because ICE gets it wrong," explained City Solicitor Marcel Pratt. "That's why we require a judicial order or a warrant, something from a judge that gives us the permission to hold that person." </p>
<p>ICE obtained judicial warrants for just six of the 164 detainer requests. An ICE spokesman told ProPublica and the Inquirer in an email that there's "no known mechanism for a federal judge or magistrate to issue an arrest warrant for civil/administrative immigration related offenses." </p>
<p>O'Neill, however, testified that ICE can ask the U.S. Attorney's Office to request a warrant from a magistrate judge, so long as an immigrant has committed an immigration-related crime, such as re-entering the country after being deported. He insisted that are few instances where that criteria applies. </p>
<p>The government's arguments wilted under scrutiny from U.S.  District Judge Michael M. Baylson, who argued in a 93-page ruling that ICE could easily devise a solution to the judicial warrant conundrum if it really wanted to. </p>
<p>Baylson — who was appointed by George W. Bush — wrote that the Justice Department "fails to provide any reason why the attorney general, or the local U.S. Attorney, and the Secretary of DHS, or a local ICE official, cannot adopt, very quickly, changes in current procedures" to ensure that it can meet the city's request. "This procedure could then be used in circumstances in which the United States Attorney's Office seeks a judicial order that the individual be taken into custody by ICE upon release from the City prison."</p>
<p>ICE's other oft-stated gripe is that Kenney's policies have deprived the agency of crucial intelligence. O'Neill testified that ICE used to receive daily emails from Lock and Track, a directory compiled by Philadelphia prison officials that contains the names of inmates — and their citizenship information. An even bigger blow came in July, when Kenney, Krasner and other officials gathered at City Hall to announce that they would not renew a contract that gave ICE agents access to PARS, a citywide database of real-time arrest information that includes a person's social security number and country of birth.</p>
<p>Kenney, who is moved to tears easily, grew emotional. "All of us have ancestors who were immigrants once," he said. "All of us." ICE officials howled that the PARS decision would jeopardize public safety. Yet here, again, was an another instance where the public relations battle masked the fuller picture. </p>
<p>Despite Kenney's sincere words and the political show of force, there were gaps in the wall the city supposedly erected to keep out ICE. </p>
<p>O'Neill testified that Philadelphia police officials had contacted ICE, and instructed agents to pick up immigrants who had been arrested by local cops, on "less than 10" occasions since Kenney took office. City officials termed it a misunderstanding that was easily corrected. But Deputy Managing Director Brian Abernathy admitted that he, too, had personally reached out to ICE on five occasions in 2017 to give the agency a heads up about undocumented immigrants who were set to be released from city jails.</p>
<p>"It was a clear violation of our policy, and something we've talked about at length," Abernathy said in an interview with ProPublica and the Inquirer. "At the time, I thought it was the right thing to do. Looking back on it, I don't think it was." </p>
<p>The five had been charged with serious offenses: rape, attempted murder, kidnapping, criminal conspiracy. "I have dwelled on this a lot. We've talked to all of our stakeholders and let them know what happened," he said. "It's a hard issue, and I've beaten myself up about it." </p>
<p>And for all of ICE's handwringing about losing the PARS contract, it still has a mountain of information at its fingertips. O'Neill testified that the agency utilizes seven other federal and local databases that offer a variety of information on people who end up on its radar. ICE even regained access to Lock and Track, the prison directory.  "It was reinstated probably in the middle of the trial," Abernathy said. "Before the judge's ruling." </p>
<p>Subhead TK</p>
<p>There are overlooked immigration battles playing out in other corners of Philadelphia politics that could hold lessons for sanctuary cities across the country.</p>
<p>The most notable involves the District Attorney's Office, which is undergoing an unprecedented overhaul under Larry Krasner, the former defense lawyer who was elected DA last year on a reformer's platform of ending cash bail and prosecuting police officers for on-duty shootings. </p>
<p>One of his first decisions as DA was to create a special position for immigrant affairs. He hired Caleb Arnold, a bespectacled former public defender who had been working at a local immigration law firm, to the post. Arnold's role was intended to help minimize the potential impact criminal convictions have on legal or undocumented immigrants who commit low-level offenses. </p>
<p>If an immigrant is here under a legal visa and convicted of a felony, they will almost certainly be stripped of it. If they are undocumented, they'll lose all narrow hope of receiving relief from deportation through a humanitarian visa. Arnold was expected to find creative solutions, like diverting someone with a history of addiction into a rehabilitation program instead of prison, or downgrading an assault charge from a felony to a misdemeanor. </p>
<p>One morning in late May, Arnold arrived at an eighth-floor courtroom in Philadelphia's imposing Juanita Kidd Stout Center for Criminal Justice, where a nervous-looking kid in short-sleeved button down and saggy blue jeans milled about in the hallway. </p>
<p>Jose Ramirez-Disla was a 19-year-old from the Dominican Republic who had lived in the U.S. on a green card for almost two years. And now his life here was about to come to a screeching halt.  </p>
<p>In the spring of 2017, Ramirez-Disla got into a fight inside the Chihuahua, a busy neighborhood bar in Olney. He chucked a beer bottle at another man, fracturing his orbital bone, and was charged with a felony count of aggravated assault, along with simple assault, reckless endangerment and possessing an instrument of crime. If he was convicted of a felony, he'd automatically face deportation. </p>
<p>That's where Arnold came in. </p>
<p>For 20 minutes, Ramirez-Disla's lawyer, a young city prosecutor, and a translator huddled in the hallway with Arnold, who wore a pink flower-patterned blazer and sketched out the terms of a favorable deal:  If Ramirez-Disla pleaded to a misdemeanor and took 11 months with no probation and no right to appeal, the DA's office would drop the more serious charge, and he'd get another chance to stay in the country on good terms. </p>
<p>"That's fair, he has to pay his time," Arnold explained. "It takes into consideration his ability to stay here."  </p>
<p>Ramirez-Disla agreed, and began serving his sentence as a city detention center a few weeks later.</p>
<p>For immigration advocates working under Trump's aggressive deportation push, it was a small victory. And for a famously progressive district attorney like Krasner, it represented the type of balance he hoped the office could achieve: The commonwealth still got a conviction, and Ramirez-Disla had a chance to avoid a date with ICE.</p>
<p>Such collaborations, prosecutors working with defense attorneys to hash out favorable outcomes for the defendant, had been largely unthinkable before Krasner took office. Now, Arnold estimates the office assess about 12 cases a week — more than 200 since February — though they don't intervene in all of them.</p>
<p>>"Maybe we would be able to achieve [arrangements like] that under Seth Williams," said Robin Forrest, an immigration attorney with the Defender Association of Philadelphia, invoking the name of Krasner's predecessor, who is now serving a federal prison sentence for bribery. </p>
<p>"But Caleb and the Krasner administration will often go further than that with us. They will occasionally drop the most serious charge, but maybe to compensate for that, beef up the sentencing on the lesser charges. They'll be much more creative in working out deals with us." </p>
<p>ProPublica and the Inquirer requested detailed information about cases Arnold has overseen. The DA's Office only agreed to provide anonymized summaries of nine cases with different outcomes, including Ramirez-Disla's. In another case, a defendant was charged with robbery and theft after stealing someone's backpack as they left an ATM. After Arnold's review, they were offered a downgrade to simple assault and theft with a recommended sentence of 5.5-11 months. A case of a green card resident who was charged with possession of child pornography, meanwhile, was left undisturbed.</p>
<p>Krasner has faced backlash from veteran prosecutors and even judges to this newfound approach. He's still crafting a formal guideline for Arnold's office, and said he won't consider deals for violent offenders. "When you try to behead somebody," he said, "I'm not feeling the love to find fourteen different ways to help that person." </p>

            {% set quote = ["This is a quote here", "Source of quote"] %} {% include "partials/left-quote.html" %}

<p>Kenney's and Krasner's lofty policies have been quietly undermined, however, by another arm of the criminal justice system: the Philadelphia Adult Probation and Parole Department. </p>
<p>Wright said the Defender Office has at least a dozen "documented instances" of probation officers notifying ICE that they have clients who might be in the U.S. illegally, thanks to a quirky loophole. The department is run by the First Judicial District, and thus not covered by Kenney's executive order. </p>
<p>"The probation department believes they are required to comply with any request for information from ICE," Wright said. "They look at ICE as any other law enforcement agency." </p>
<p>Probation and Parole officials declined to be interviewed by ProPublica and the Inquirer. But Krasner and Kenney were aware of Wright's claims, and at a meeting in September, the probation department agreed to begin following the city's sanctuary policy, and restrict probation officers from asking clients about their immigration statuses, or contacting ICE if they learn someone is undocumented. </p>

            {% set quote = ["This is a quote here", "Source of quote"] %} {% include "partials/left-quote.html" %}

<p>The sanctuary umbrella doesn't provide perfect protection even to immigrants who are victims of violent crimes. In the last year, the police department has approved 203 requests for U-Visas, which provide a path to citizenship for victims who agree to cooperate with investigators. But a national backlog means that they can wait up to a decade for their application to be fully approved, and they aren't exempted from deportation proceedings during that time. </p>
<p>Still, for all its imperfections, undocumented immigrants are drawn to Philadelphia, hoping to find refuge and a small piece of the American dream somewhere in the shadows of the gleaming new skyscrapers and old rowhouse neighborhoods. </p>
<p>Enid Melissa Bartolometi, a Puerto Rico native who lives in South Jersey, smiled as she sat in a Starbucks recently and described a romantic stroll she shared one night with her fiance, Pablo Castillo Trujillo, along Penn's Landing in Philadelphia. </p>
<p>They were in love and newly engaged, and fantasized about building a life together in Jersey, where Trujillo worked as a landscaper and helped Bartolometi take her of her parents and disabled nephew. The couple made multiple trips to the Mexican Consulate in the heart of Philadelphia's historic district, believing that officials there could craft a path to citizenship for Trujillo, 41, who entered the country from Mexico illegally early last year.  </p>
<p>On April 16 -- less than two weeks after Trump complained in a series of tweets about border security and immigrants pouring into the country "unchecked" -- Enid heard a knock on her front door. She found two men standing there in vests that identified them as ICE agents. One was looking through her mail, which included bills that were addressed to Pablo and his brother, who was also undocumented. </p>
<p>"Is Pablo here?" the agent asked. "We want to talk to him."  </p>
<p>"He's not," she said. "What's this about?"</p>

            {% set quote = ["This is a quote here", "Source of quote"] %} {% include "partials/left-quote.html" %}

<p>Panic-stricken, Bartolomei called the consulate in Philadelphia. She was told to leave her apartment and not return. She and Trujillo spent the night at her parents', and planned to drive back to Philadelphia the following day. Maybe they'd head for the consulate. Maybe they'd seek sanctuary for Trujillo in a church. Maybe this, maybe that. </p>

                {% include "partials/subscribebox.html" %}

<p>They climbed into Bartolomei's little Ford sedan in the morning and left her parents' development. They could make it to Philadelphia in 15 minutes. They didn't get far. A cruiser filled with ICE agents swooped in, and Trujillo was dragged away. </p>

{% set ad = ["22"] %} {% include "partials/ad.html" %}

<p>A month later, he was deported to Mexico. ICE officials said that he had been deported once before, while he claimed that he had entered the U.S. briefly in 2015 and left voluntarily. </p>
<p>Bartolomei dabbed at her eyes with napkins in the coffee shop as she wept over photos of Trujillo on her phone. Their wedding plans are indefinitely on hold. The path she thought they'd been on has been washed away, leaving her to grapple alone with the painful thought of so many what-could-have-beens. </p>
<p>What good had a sanctuary city done for them in the end? </p>
<p>"It doesn't mean anything," Bartolomei said. "ICE just finds a way around it."</p>
